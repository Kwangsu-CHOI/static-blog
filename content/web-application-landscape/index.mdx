PWAs are bridging the gap between web and mobile applications. They offer a
native-like experience while leveraging the benefits of the web, such as
accessibility and discoverability.
```

**Key features of PWAs include:**

- Offline functionality: Users can access core features even without an internet connection.

- Push notifications: Engage users with timely updates and alerts.

- Installability: PWAs can be installed on the home screen for quick access.

## Serverless Architecture

Serverless architecture is gaining traction as it allows developers to focus on writing code without managing servers. This approach offers scalability, cost-efficiency, and faster development cycles.

- Scalability: Serverless functions automatically scale to handle varying workloads, ensuring optimal performance.

- Cost-efficiency: Pay only for the compute time used, reducing infrastructure costs.

- Faster development: Focus on writing code without server management overhead.

## Jamstack

Jamstack is a modern architecture for building fast, secure, and pre-rendered websites. It combines JavaScript, APIs, and Markup for a streamlined development process.

- Performance: Pre-rendering improves load times and SEO.
- Security: Reducing server-side code minimizes attack vectors.
- Scalability: Easily handle increased traffic with cloud-based CDNs.

## Cybersecurity

As web applications become more complex and handle sensitive data, cybersecurity is paramount. Key trends include:

- Zero-trust architecture: Implementing strict access controls and continuous verification.
- End-to-end encryption: Protecting data at rest and in transit.
- Regular security audits: Identifying vulnerabilities and implementing patches.

## Emerging Technologies
